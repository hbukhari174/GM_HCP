Graph Matching the Human Connectome 


Here is the code for the analysis we conducted on results from graph matching, the code for the graph matching can be found by contacting Dr. Chang Su.
The necessary files that are needed alongside this are pairwisegraphmatching test results and retest results. 

RelatednessAnalysis is for Figure 2a --> swap percents between test-retest, mz, dz, fs, non-related and age-matched non-related pairs. 

AgeAnalysis --> comparision of swap percent for 
NR, NR f-f, NR m-m, NR m-f and their age-matched subsets. 

CFC --> all pairs
cfcm --> m-m piars
cfcf --> f-f pairs


SwapFrequency --> Violin Plot, Region to Region Swap Frequency and Network to Network Swap Frequency. 

Used Keith Jamison's code for the regional swap frequency visualization.
